# Hashlib python

* The Python hashlib module is an interface for hashing messages easily. 
* This contains numerous methods which will handle hashing any raw message in an encrypted format. 
* The core purpose of this module is to use a hash function on a string, and encrypt it so that it is very difficult to decrypt it.
* It takes variable length of bytes and converts it into a fixed length sequence.
